# Tyler-Slussar-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of Tyler Slussar's completed or created work.

During my time in undergraduate school at Capital University in Bexley, Ohio. I studied computer science and mathematics. This repository 
is a portfolio of the programs I have either built or successfully completed during my time in undergraduate school. Most programs were 
designed by a professor and I had to use my skill to successfully complete the project at hand. 

This portfolio is solely available to showcase my knowledge and style of writing code. I am not claiming any of these items as my own. Most were either project with a partner or completion of code that was given to me. This portfolio demonstrates the languages I have learned and the knowledge I have gathered in my years of undergraduate.

I mostly used Python and C++ during my undergrad. However, I have learned a bit of SQL, studied Java a bit for a project, learned very little and
basic HTML, and a little bit of Sage and R.

I have studied a vast variety in the computer field. Learned about computer hardware and software, studied algorithms, learned about
computer networks and computer security, understood computer graphics, looked into databases, studied computer architecture, and finally
explore software design and engineering.

Professors Included:
