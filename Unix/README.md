During my senior year I decided to take an elective course entitled Introduction to Unix. All the files in this directory are
executable files. I choose to include these files to showcase my ability to learn programming languages and the understanding of 
a command line interface. I learned how to use commands, arguments, and other command lines ideology within this Unix course.
