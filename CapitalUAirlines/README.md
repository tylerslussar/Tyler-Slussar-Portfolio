CapitalU Airlines was a project created by Javier Mendoza and I, Tyler Slussar during 
a software engineering course at Capital University. The project was to design your own 
airline UI that met certain requirements. One of those requirements was building a specific 
seating algorithm to ensure passengers are seated correctly.
