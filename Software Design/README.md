During a software design course in undergrad, I was taught that the thought and design 
was also or even more important than building the programs themselves. This folder 
consists of many programs and my thought process on how to build them effectively and 
successfully. Some programs may not be 100% accurate or 100% successful. The purpose of 
providing this information is to showcase who I am as an individual and my thought process.
